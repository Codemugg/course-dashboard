            <h2>OOP USING PYTHON :</h2><br /><br>
            Object-oriented programming is the latest programming paradigm based on the concept of
            "objects", which can contain attributes and itâ€™s method: attributes in the form of fields, and
            methods, in the form of procedures. A feature of objects is that an object's own procedures
            can access and often modify the data fields of itself.<br><br>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Classes & Objects :</h2><br>
            Classes and Objects are the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming.<br>
            In Python, everything is an object!<br>
            A variable (object) is just an instance of its type (class).<br>
            That's why when you check the type of a variable you can see the class keyword right next to its
            type (class).<br>
            This code snippet shows that my_string is an object and it is an instance of the class str.<br><br>
            <div class="code">
                | my_string = 'I love coding.'<br>
                | print(my_string)<br>
                | print(type(my_string))<br>
            </div>
            <div class="codeout">
                | 'I love coding.'<br>
                | &#60; class 'str' &#62;
            </div>
            <div class="subtitle">Differentiate Class x Object</div><br>
            The class gives you a standard way to create objects. A class is like a base project.
            Say you are an engineer working for Boeing.<br>
            Your new mission is to build the new product for the company, a new model called 747-Space.
            This aircraft flies higher altitudes than other commercial models.<br>
            Boeing needs to build dozens of those to sell to airlines all over the world, and the aircrafts have
            to be all the same. To guarantee that the aircrafts (objects) follow the same standards, you need
            to have a project (class) that can be replicable.<br>
            The class is a project, a blueprint for an object. This way you make the project once, and reuse
            it many times.<br>
            In our code example before, consider that every string has the same behavior and the same
            attributes. So it only makes sense for strings to have a class str to define them.<br>
            <div class="subtitle">Attributes and Methods</div><br>
            Objects have some behavior which is given by attributes and methods.<br>
            In simple terms, in the context of an object, attributes are variables and methods are functions
            attached to an object.<br>
            For example, a string has many built-in methods that we can use.<br>
            They work like functions, you just need to separate them from the objects using a -- In this code
            snippet, I'm calling the <b>replace()</b> method from the string variable string which is an object,
            and an instance of the class str. The replace() method replaces a part of the string for another
            and returns a new string with the change. The original string remains the same.<br>
            <div class="code">
                |  string = 'This is a string.'<br>
                |  print(string.replace('string', 'sentence'))<br>
                |  print(string)<br>
            </div>
            <div class="codeout">
                |  This is a sentence.<br>
                |  This is a string.<br>
            </div>
            <div class="subtitle">Creating a Class: </div><br>
            We have used many objects (instances of classes) like strings, integers, lists, and dictionaries.
            All of them are instances of predefined classes in Python.<br>
            To create our own classes we use the class keyword.<br>
            By convention, the name of the class matches the name of the .py file and the module by
            consequence. It is also a good practice to organize the code. Create a file vehicle.py with the
            following class Vehicle.<br><br>
            <div class="code">
                |  # FileName = vechicle.py<br>
                | class Vehicle:<br>
                | &nbsp; def __init__(self, year, model, plate_number, current_speed = 0):<br>
                | &nbsp; &nbsp; self.year = year<br>
                | &nbsp; &nbsp; self.model = model<br>
                | &nbsp; &nbsp; self.plate_number = plate_number<br>
                | &nbsp; &nbsp; self.current_speed = current_speed<br>
                |<br>
                | &nbsp; def move(self):<br>
                | &nbsp; &nbsp; self.current_speed += 1<br>
                |<br>
                | &nbsp; def accelerate(self, value):<br>
                | &nbsp; &nbsp; self.current_speed += value<br>
                | <br>
                | &nbsp; def stop(self):<br>
                | &nbsp; &nbsp; self.current_speed = 0<br>
                |<br>
                | &nbsp; def vechicledetails(self):<br>
                | &nbsp; &nbsp; return self.model + ', ' + str(self.year) + ', ' + self.plate_number<br>
            </div>
            Let's break down the class to explain it in parts.<br>
            The <b>class</b> keyword is used to specify the name of the class Vehicle.<br>
            The <b>__init__</b> function is a built-in function that all classes have. It is called when an object is
            created and is often used to initialize the attributes, assigning values to them, similar to what is
            done to variables.<br>
            The first parameter <b>self</b> in the __init__ function is a reference to the object (instance) itself.
            We call it self by convention and it has to be the first parameter in every instance method, as
            you can see in the other method definitions <b>def move(self)</b>, <b>def accelerate(self, value)</b>, 
            <b>def stop(self)</b>, and <b>def vehicle_details(self)</b>.<br>
            Vehicle has 5 attributes (including self): <b>year</b>,<b> model</b>, <b>plate_number</b>, and
            <b>current_speed</b>.<br>
            Inside the __init__, each one of them is initialized with the parameters given when the object
            is instantiated.<br>
            Notice that <b>current_speed</b> is initialized with 0 by default, meaning that if no value is given,
            current_speed will be equal to 0 when the object is first instantiated.<br>
            Finally, we have three methods to manipulate our vehicle regarding its speed: def
            move(self), def accelerate(self, value), and def stop(self). And one method
            to give back information about the vehicle: def vehicle_details(self).<br>
            The implementation inside the methods work the same way as in functions. You can also have a
            return to give you back some value at the end of the method as demonstrated by <b>def vehicle_details(self).</b><br>
            <div class="subtitle">Using the Class: </div><br><br>
            To use the class in your terminal, import the Vehicle class from the vehicle module.<br>
            Create an instance called my_car, initializing year with 2009, model with 'F8', plate_number
            with 'ABC1234', and current_speed with 100.<br>
            The self parameter is not taken into consideration when calling methods. The Python interpreter
            infers its value as being the current object/instance automatically, so we just have to pass the
            other arguments when instantiating and calling methods.<br>
            Now use the methods to <b>move()</b> the car which increases its current_speed by 1,
            <b>accelerate(10)</b> which increases its current_speed by the value given in the argument, and
            <b>stop()</b> which sets the current_speed to 0.<br>
            Remember to print the value of current_speed at every command to see the changes.<br>
            To finish the test, call <b>vehicle_details()</b> to print the information about our vehicle.<br><br>

            </div>
            If we don't set the initial value for <b>current_speed</b>, it will be zero by
            default as stated before and demonstrated in the next example.
            <div class="code">

            <h2>INHERITANCE : </h2><br>
            Let's define a generic Vehicle class and save it inside the <b>vehicle.py</b> file.<br><br>
            <div class="code">
                |  # FileName = vechicle.py<br>
                | class Vehicle:<br>
                | &nbsp; def __init__(self, year, model, plate_number, current_speed = 0):<br>
                | &nbsp; &nbsp; self.year = year<br>
                | &nbsp; &nbsp; self.model = model<br>
                | &nbsp; &nbsp; self.plate_number = plate_number<br>
                | &nbsp; &nbsp; self.current_speed = current_speed<br>
                |<br>
                | &nbsp; def move(self):<br>
                | &nbsp; &nbsp; self.current_speed += 1<br>
                |<br>
                | &nbsp; def accelerate(self, value):<br>
                | &nbsp; &nbsp; self.current_speed += value<br>
                | <br>
                | &nbsp; def stop(self):<br>
                | &nbsp; &nbsp; self.current_speed = 0<br>
                |<br>
                | &nbsp; def vechicledetails(self):<br>
                | &nbsp; &nbsp; return self.model + ', ' + str(self.year) + ', ' + self.plate_number<br>
            </div>
            A vehicle has attributes <b>year</b>,<b> model</b>, <b>plate_number</b>, and <b>current_speed</b>.<br>
            The definition of vehicle in the Vehicle is very generic and might
            not be suitable for trucks, for instance, because it should include
            a cargo attribute.<br>
            On the other hand, a cargo attribute does not make much sense
            for small vehicles like motorcycles.<br>
            To solve this we can use <i>inheritance</i>.<br>
            When a class (child) inherits another class (parent), all the
            attributes and methods from the parent class are inherited by the
            child class.<br><br>
            <div class="subtitle">Parent and Child</div><br>
            In our case, we want a new <b>Truck</b> class to inherit everything from
            the <b>Vehicle</b> class. Then we want it to add its own specific
            attribute <b>current_cargo</b> to control the addition and removal of
            cargo from the truck.<br>
            The Truck class is called a <i>child</i> class that inherits from its parent
            class <i>Vehicle</i>.<br>
            A parent class is also called a <i>superclass</i> while a child class is also
            known as a <i>subclass</i>.<br>
            Create the class Truck and save it inside the <i>truck.py</i> file.<br><br>
            <div class="code">
                | from vehicle import Vehicle<br>
                | class Truck(Vehicle):<br>
                | &nbsp; def __init__(self, year, model, plate_number,current_speed, current_cargo):<br>
                | &nbsp; &nbsp; super().__init__(year, model, plate_number, current_speed)<br>
                | &nbsp; &nbsp; self.current_cargo = current_cargo<br>
                | <br>
                | &nbsp; def add_cargo(self, cargo):<br>
                | &nbsp; &nbsp; self.current_cargo += cargo<br>
                |<br>
                | &nbsp; def remove_cargo(self, cargo):<br>

            </div>
            Let's break down the class to explain it in parts.<br> 
            The class Vehicle inside the parentheses when defining the class
            Truck indicates that the parent <b>Vehicle</b> is being inherited by its
            child <b>Truck</b>Truck.<br> 
            The __init__ method has self as its first parameter, as usual.<br> 
            The parameters <b>year</b>,<b> model</b>, <b>plate_number</b>, and <b>current_speed</b> are
            there to match the ones in the Vehicle class.<br>
            We added a new parameter <b>current_cargo</b> suited for the Truck.<br>
            In the first line of the __init__ method of the <b>Truck</b> class we have
            to call the<b> __init__</b>  method of the <b>Vehicle</b> class.<br>
            class.<br>
            To do that we use super() to make a reference to the supperclass
            Vehicle, so when <b>super().__init__(year, model, plate_number,
            current_speed)</b> is called we avoid repetition of our code.<br>
            After that, we can assign the value of current_cargo normally.<br>
            Finally, we have two methods to deal with the <b>current_cargo: def
            add_cargo(self, cargo):</b>, and <b>def remove_cargo(self, cargo):</b>.<br>
            Remember that Truck inherits attributes and methods from
            Vehicle, so we also have an implicit access to the methods that
            manipulate the speed: <b>def move(self)</b>, <b>def accelerate(self,
            value)</b>, and <b>def stop(self)</b>.
            <div class="subtitle">Using Truck Class: </div><br>
            To use the class in your terminal, import the Truck class from the
            truck module.<br>
            Create an instance called <b>my_truck</b>, initializing <b>year</b> with 2015,
        <b>model</b> with 'V8', <b>plate_number</b> with 'XYZ1234', <b>current_speed</b> with
            0, and </b>current_cargo</b> with 0.<br>
            Use <b>add_cargo(10)</b> to increase <b>current_cargo</b>b> by 10,<br>
            <b>remove_cargo(4)</b>, to decrease current_cargo by 4.<br>
            Remember to print the value of current_cargo at every command
            to see the changes.<br>
            By inheritance, we can use the methods from the Vehicle class to
            move() the truck which increases its <b>current_speed</b> by 1,
        <b>accelerate(10)</b> which increases its current_speed by the value
            given in the argument, and <b>stop()</b> which sets the current_speed
            to 0.<br>
            Remember to print the value of <b>current_speed</b> at every
            interaction to see the changes.<br>
            To finish the test, call <b>vehicle_details()</b> inherited from the
            Vehicle class to print the information about our truck.<br><br>
