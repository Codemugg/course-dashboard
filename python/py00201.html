            <h2>INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON PROGRAMMING:</h2><br /></div>
          <div>
            <h2>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS: </h2><br>
            Conditionals are one of the cornerstones of any programming language. They allow you
            to control the program flow according to specific conditions. A conditional Statement is like a
            control structure: a block of code which makes decisions analyzing the values of variables.<br>
            The keywords ‘<b>if</b>’, ‘ <b>else</b> ’ and ‘ <b>elif</b> ’ are used to implement conditional
            statements in python. It allows the execution of a particular block of code conditionally.<br>
            Following pseudocode displays the syntax of conditional statements:
            <br><br>
            <div class="code">
                1.  | if ( CONDITION_IS_TRUE ): <br>
                2.  |<br>
                3.  |       &nbsp; Execute Following block of code<br>
                4.  |       &nbsp; BLOCK 1<br>
                5.  |<br>
                6.  | else:<br>
                7.  |<br>
                8.  |       &nbsp; Execute Following block of code<br>
                9.  |       &nbsp; BLOCK 2<br>
            </div>
            The above pseudocode explains that you can define two conditional statements simultaneously.
            If the condition on line 2 turns out to be true, then the block of code written in BLOCK 1 is
            executed, otherwise the control is passed on to the BLOCK 2.<br><br>
            <div class="subtitle">if statement: </div><br>
            The block of code written inside the if statement is only executed, if the condition at the
            start is true.<br>
            The general form of a if statement is:<br><br>
            <div class="code">
                1.  | if ( CONDITION_IS_TRUE ): <br>
                2.  |<br>
                3.  |       &nbsp; Execute Following block of code<br><br></div>
            The condition contains some logic that returns a boolean, and the statement is executed only if
            the return is True.<br><br>
            You’ll understand the use of if statement using following example:<br><br>
            <div class='code'>
                | Cost_apples = 50.00<br>
                | Cost_mangoes = 45.00<br>
                | if (Cost_apples > Cost_mangoes):<br>
                | &nbsp; print('Apples are costly.')<br>
              </div>
              <div class='codeout'>
                | Apples are costly.
              </div>
              As the condition after the if statement is evaluated to true. The program executes the statement
              after the ‘<b> if </b>’ condition and prints ‘ <b>Apples are costly.</b> ’<br><br>
              <div class="subtitle">if, else Statement: </div><br>
              In our last example, the program only does something if the condition returns True.<br><br>
              But we also want it to do something if it returns False or even check a second or third condition
             if the first one went wrong.<br><br>
             In the following code we’ll change the condition to Cost_apples < Cost_mangoes. Hence, the
            first expression will return False since Apples are costlier than mangoes, and the program will
            execute the code written in else block.<br><br>
            <div class='code'>
                | Cost_apples = 50.00<br>
                | Cost_mangoes = 45.00<br>
                | if (Cost_apples < Cost_mangoes):<br>
                | &nbsp; print('Mangoes are costly.')<br>
                | else:<br>
                | &nbsp; print('Apples are costly.')<br>
              </div>
              <div class='codeout'>
                | Apples are costly.
              </div>
              As the program executes the block of code written after ‘ else ’ is displayed on the console.
              <br><br>
              <div class="subtitle">elif Statement: </div><br>
              Let's change the cost of mangoes to 50.00.<br><br>
              Now, to check whether the price of apples and mangoes is equal, you can include an ‘<b>elif</b>  ’
              condition in your program<br><br>
             In the following code we’ll change the condition to Cost_apples < Cost_mangoes. Hence, the
            first expression will return False since Apples are costlier than mangoes, and the program will
            execute the code written in else block.<br><br>
            <div class='code'>
                | Cost_apples = 50.00<br>
                | Cost_mangoes = 45.00<br>
                | if (Cost_apples < Cost_mangoes):<br>
                | &nbsp; print('Mangoes are costly.')<br>
                | elif (Cost_apples == Cost_mangoes):<br>
                | &nbsp; print('Apples and Mangoes cost the same.')<br>
                | else:<br>
                | &nbsp; print('Apples are costly.')<br>
              </div>
              <div class='codeout'>
                | Apples and Mangoes cost the same.
              </div>
              The condition in the ‘ elif ’ is met. Since, the cost of both the fruits are equal the program
                will print ‘Apples and Mangoes cost the same. ’ on the console.
              <br><br>
              <b>Note: </b> You can have as many elifs as you want, just put them in sequence.<br><br>
              <div class="subtitle">Nested conditions: </div><br>
              There are times when you have to consider more than a single condition to perform a particular
            task. You can use Nested if statements or Nested if else statements.<br><br>
            For example,<br>
            Lets develop a program which checks whether an year is a leap year or not.<br><br>
              <div class='code'>
                | # You can try executing the program for different values of year.<br>
                | year = 2016<br>

                | if (year%4==0):<br>
                |    &nbsp;  if (year%100==0):<br>
                |       &nbsp; &nbsp; if (year%400==0):<br>
                |          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  print('This is a leap year.')<br>
                |        &nbsp; &nbsp; else:<br>
                |           &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print("It's not a leap year.")<br>
                |    &nbsp; else:<br>
                |        &nbsp; &nbsp; print("This is a leap year.")<br>
                | else:<br>
                |    &nbsp; print("It's not a leap year.")<br>

              </div>
              <div class='codeout'>
                | This is a leap year.
              </div>
              The above code checks whether a year is a leap year or not. We have used three if statements
                which are all associated with an else statement.<br><br>
                <div class="subtitle">Ternary Operator: </div>
                The ternary operator is a one-line if statement.<br>
                It's very handy for simple conditions.<br><br>
                This is how it looks:<br><br>
              <div class='code'>
                | ( EXPRESSION ) if ( CONDITION ) else ( EXPRESSION )
              </div>

              Lets execute a python program to evaluate the cost of fruits, just like we did earlier, using
              ternary operators.
              <br><br>
              <div class='code'>
                | Cost_apples = 50.00<br>
                | Cost_mangoes = 45.00<br>
                | print('Apples are not costly.') if Cost_apples < Cost_mangoes else print('Apples are costly.')
              </div>
              <div class='codeout'>
                | Apples are costly.<br>
              </div>
              In the above code, the condition <b> ( Cost_apples < Cost_mangoes )</b> is evaluated to False.
            Hence, the statement mentioned prior to<b> if</b> condition are not executed.
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>LOOPS: </h2><br>
            A loop continuously executes a specific block of code until a particular condition is
            satisfied.<br>
            In this section, you’ll learn about various kinds of loops and their implementation in the python
            programming.<br>
            There are two types of loops: for and while. You will learn about while loops in the next
            section.<br><br>
            <div class="subtitle">for Loops: </div><br>
            A for loop is used to iterate through an iterable. This process is called iterating. You
            can use a for-loop to define instructions that execute once for every item in an iterable, and you
            can access and manipulate each item in the iterable from within the instructions you defined.<br><br>
            <div class="code">
                  | for ELEMENT in COLLECTION: <br>
                  |  &nbsp; ( STATEMENTS ) 
            </div>
            For example,<br>
            You can use a for loop to access all the characters in a string.<br><br>
            <div class="code">
                | string = ('CODEMUGG')<br>
                | for char in string: <br>
                |  &nbsp; print(char)
          </div>
          <div class="codeout">
            | C<br>
            | O <br>
            | D<br>
            | E<br>
            | M <br>
            | U <br>
            | G<br>
            | G<br>
            </div>
            In the above code, using a for loop we traverse through each character in a string and print
            them one at a time.<br><br>
            You can use for-loops to change the items in a mutable iterable, like a list:<br><br>
            <div class="code">
                | my_list = ['Welcome','to','Codemugg']<br>
                | for words in my_list: <br>
                |  &nbsp; print(words.upper())
          </div>
          <div class="codeout">
            | WELCOME <br>
            | TO <br>
            | CODEMUGG
            </div>
            In the above program, we used a string method i.e. <b>upper()</b> which converts all the
            characters of a string to uppercase.<br><br>
            <h2>What if you want to iterate through a range of numbers.. ?</h2><br><br>
            For that purpose we have an inbuilt range function called as <b> range()</b> .<br><br>
            <div class="subtitle">Range() : </div>
            The range function is widely used in for loops because it gives you a simple way to list
            numbers.<br>
            The following code will loop through the numbers 0 to 5 and print each of them.<br><br>
            <div class="code">
                | for num in range(5): <br>
                |    &nbsp; print(num)
          </div>
          <div class="codeout">
            | 0 <br>
            | 1 <br>
            | 2 <br>
            | 3 <br>
            | 4 <br>
            </div>
            The range() function takes a lower bound and an upper bound as its arguments. But if you just
            pass a single number as an argument like in the above code, it is considered as upper limit. And
            the lower limit is set to 0 by default, that’s why the numbers that range between 0 to 5 are
            displayed in the output.<br><br>
            Finally, it is also possible to set a step.<br>
            Here we are starting at 10 and incrementing by 2 until 20, since 20 is the upper limit, it is not
            included.<br><br>
            <div class="code">
                | for num in range(10,20,2): <br>
                |    &nbsp; print(num)
          </div>
          <div class="codeout">
            | 10 <br>
            | 12 <br>
            | 14 <br>
            | 16 <br>
            | 18 <br>
            </div>
            If you want to terminate a loop in between its execution, you can use a break statement for it.<br><br>
            <div class="subtitle">Break : </div>
            A break keyword is used to stop the execution of a loop.<br><br>
            <div class="code">
                | my_country = ['India','Argentina','Canada','Brazil']<br>
                | for country in my_country: <br>
                |  &nbsp; print(country)<br>
                | &nbsp; if country == 'Canada':<br>
                |  &nbsp; &nbsp; break<br>
          </div>
          <div class="codeout">
            | India <br>
            | Argentina <br>
            | Canada
            </div>
            The above code illustrates the use of break statement. The countries in the loop are printed until
            the if condition is evaluated to true. When the if condition is statisfied the loop is
            terminated.<br><br>
            If you just want to skip a particular element from a list and continue the execution of the next
            statement, you can use a <b>continue</b> keyword to skip the element.<br><br>
            <div class="subtitle">Continue : </div><br>
            A continue keyword is used to skip a specific element from a list.<br>
            Let’s try using a continue keyword in the above example:
            <br><br>
            <div class="code">
                | my_country = ['India','Argentina','Canada','Brazil']<br>
                | for country in my_country: <br>
                | &nbsp; if country == 'Canada':<br>
                |  &nbsp; &nbsp; continue<br>
                |  &nbsp; print(country)<br>
          </div>
          <div class="codeout">
            | India <br>
            | Argentina <br>
            | Brazil
            </div>
            The above program prints all the countries in list which doesn’t statisfies the if condition.<br>
            When the iterator reaches to ‘ <b>Canada</b> ’ the block of code after the condition is eliminated and
            the execution is continued from next country i.e. ‘ <b>Brazil</b> ’.<br>
            <div class="subtitle">Nested For loop : </div><br>
            Sometimes you have more complex collections, like a list of lists. To iterate over these lists, you
            need nested for loops<br>
            Following code will help you to understand the use of nested for loops.
            <br><br>
            <div class="code">
                | my_country = [['BMW I8', 'BMW X3','BMW X1'],<br>
                &nbsp;  &nbsp; ['Ferrari 812', 'Ferrari F8','Ferrari GTC4'],<br>
                &nbsp;  &nbsp; ['McLaren 570S', 'McLaren 570GT','McLaren 720S']]<br>
                <br>
                | for brand in car_models:<br>
                | &nbsp; for model in brand:<br>
                | &nbsp; &nbsp; print(model)<br>
          </div>
          <div class="codeout">
            | BMW I8<br>
            | BMW X3<br>
            | BMW X1<br>
            | Ferrari 812<br>
            | Ferrari F8<br>
            | Ferrari GTC4<br>
            | McLaren 570S<br>
            | McLaren 570GT<br>
            | McLaren 720S<br>
            </div>
            In the above example,<br>
            Each list in car_models list, for instance [‘BMW I8’,’BMW X3’,’BMW X1’] , is collectively
            called as a brand and each element in brand is called as model and is printed on console.<br>
            <div class="subtitle">while loop : </div><br>
            The block of code written inside a while loop is only executed if the condition at the start of the
            loop is satisfied.<br>
            The syntax of a while loop is shown below:
            <br><br>
            <div class="code">
                | while ( CONDITION ):<br>
                | &nbsp; ( STATEMENTS )<br>
          </div>
          The loop will continue executing until the condition is True.<br>
          Following code is an example of implementing a while loop:<br><br>
          <div class="code">
            | # Printing square of numbers<br>
            | number = 1<br>
            | while ( number <= 5 ):<br>
            | &nbsp; print(number, ' = ', number**2)<br>
            | &nbsp; number += 1
         </div>
        <div class="codeout">
        | 1 = 1<br>
        | 2 = 4<br>
        | 3 = 9<br>
        | 4 = 16<br>
        | 5 = 25<br>
        </div>
        The code executes till the condition <b>number <= 5 </b> is met. Once, the value of number becomes
        6, the loop is terminated.<br><br>
        <div class="subtitle">else block : </div>
        When the condition at the start of the while loop returns False, the else block will be executed.
        <div class="code">
            | # Printing square of numbers<br>
            | number = 1<br>
            | while ( number <= 5 ):<br>
            | &nbsp; print(number, ' = ', number**2)<br>
            | &nbsp; number += 1<br>
            | else:<br>
            | &nbsp; print("Program executed..!")<br>
         </div>
        <div class="codeout">
        | 1 = 1<br>
        | 2 = 4<br>
        | 3 = 9<br>
        | 4 = 16<br>
        | 5 = 25<br>
        | Program executed..!
        </div>
        To break out of a while loop in Python:<br>
        Similar to the for loop, you can simply use the break keyword, and the loop will stop its
        execution.<br><br>
        <div class="code">
            | # Printing square of numbers<br>
            | number = 1<br>
            | while ( number <= 5 ):<br>
            | &nbsp; if number == 4:<br>
            | &nbsp; &nbsp; break <br>
            | &nbsp; print(number, ' = ', number**2)<br>
            | &nbsp; number += 1<br>
            | else:<br>
            | &nbsp; print("Program executed..!")<br>
         </div>
         <div class="codeout">
            | 1 = 1<br>
            | 2 = 4<br>
            | 3 = 9<br>
        </div>
            The loop runs normally, and when number reaches 4 the if statement evaluates to True and the
            break command is called. This finishes the loop before the squared value of the numbers 4 and
            5 are calculated and else the number doesn’t get incremented further, the while condition is
            always evaluated to true and the else block is never executed.<br><br>
            To skip the execution of a particular statement of a while loop in Python:
            Similar to the for loop, you can simply use the continue keyword, and the loop will skip the
            execution and continue from the next condition.<br><br>
            <div class="code">
                | # Printing square of numbers<br>
                | number = 1<br>
                | while ( number <= 5 ):<br>
                | &nbsp; number += 1<br>
                | &nbsp; if number == 4:<br>
                | &nbsp; &nbsp; continue <br>
                | &nbsp; print(number, ' = ', number**2)<br>
                | else:<br>
                | &nbsp; print("Program executed..!")<br>
             </div>
             <div class="codeout">
                | 1 = 1<br>
                | 2 = 4<br>
                | 3 = 9<br>
                | 5 = 25<br>
                | Program executed..!
            </div> 
            The program always checks if 4 is the current value of the number. If it is, the square of 4 won't
            be calculated and the continue will skip to the next iteration when the value of number is 5.  <br><br>
