            <h2>INTRODUCTION :</h2><br />
            C++ is a general-purpose programming language and widely used nowadays for
            competitive programming. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming
            features.<br><br>
            C++ runs on lots of platforms like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac, etc. Before we start
            programming with C++. We will need an environment to be set-up on our local computer
            to compile and run our C++ programs successfully. If you do not want to set up a local
            environment you can also use online IDEs for compiling your program.<br><br>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>SETTING UP LOCAL ENVIRONMENT: </h2><br>
            For setting up your own personal development environment on your local machine you
            need to install two important softwares:<br><br>
          </div>
          <div>

            <div class="subtitle">
              <b>Text Editor: </b> 
            </div><br>
            Text Editors are types of programs used to edit or write texts.
            We will use text-editors to type our C++ programs. The normal extension of
            a text file is (.txt) but a text file containing C++ program should be saved
            with ‘.CPP’ or ‘.C’ extension. Files ending with the extension ‘.CPP’ and ‘.C’
            are called source code files and they are supposed to contain source code
            written in C++ programming language. This extension helps the compiler to
            identify that the file contains a C++ program.<br>
            Before beginning programming with C++, one must have a text-editor
            installed to write programs.<br><br>
            <div class="subtitle">
              <b>C++ Compiler: </b> 
            </div><br>
            Once you have installed text-editor and typed and save your
            program in a file with ‘.CPP’ extension, you will need a C++ compiler to
            compile this file. A compiler is a computer program which converts
            high-level language into machine understandable low-level language. In
            other words, we can say that it converts the source code written in a
            programming language into another computer language which the computer
            understands. For compiling a C++ program we will need a C++ compiler
            which will convert the source code written in C++ into machine codes.
            Below are the details about setting up compiler on different platforms.
            <br><br>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>INSTALLATION: </h2><br>
            <div class="subtitle">
              <b>Linux Installation: </b> 
            </div><br>
            We will install the GNU GCC compiler on
            Linux. To install and work with the GCC compiler on your Linux
            machine, proceed according to below steps:<br>
            You have to first run the below two commands from your Linux terminal window:<br><br>
            <div class="code">
              | sudo apt-get update<br>
              | sudo apt-get install GCC<br>
            </div>
            This command will install the GCC compiler on your system. You may also run the
            below command:
            <div class="code">
              | sudo apt-get install build-essential<br>
            </div>
            <i>This command will install all the libraries which are
              required to compile and run a C++ program.</i><br><br>
              After completing the above step, you should check whether the GCC compiler is
              installed in your system correctly or not. To do this you have to run the below-given
              command from Linux terminal:<br><br>
              <div class="code">
                | g++ --version<br>
              </div>
              <i>If you have completed the above two steps without
              any errors, then your Linux environment is set up
              and ready to be used to compile C++ programs. In
              further steps, we will learn how to compile and run a
              C++ program on Linux using GCC compiler.<br><br>
              Write your program in a text file and save it with any
              file name and.CPP extension. We have written a
              program to display “Hello World” and saved it in a
              file with the filename “helloworld.cpp” on desktop.</i><br><br>
              Now you have to open the Linux terminal and move to the directory where you have
              saved your file. Then you have to run the below command to compile your file:<br><br>
              <div class="code">
                | g++ filename.cpp -o any-name
                <br>
              </div>
              <i>filename.cpp</i> is the name of your source code file. In our case, the name is
              “helloworld.cpp” and any-name can be any name of your choice. This name will be
              assigned to the executable file which is created by the compiler after compilation. In our
              case, we choose any-name to be “hello”.<br><br>
              <div class="code">
                | g++ helloworld.cpp -o hello
                <br>
              </div>
              After executing the above command, you will see a new file is created automatically in
              the same directory where you have saved the source file and the name of this file is the
              name you chose as any-name.<br>
              Now to run your program you have to run the below command:<br><br>
              <div class="code">
                | ./hello
                <br>
              </div>
              <i>This command will run your program in the terminal
                window.</i><br><br>
                <div class="subtitle">
                  <b>Windows Installation: </b> 
                </div><br>
                There are lots of IDEs available for the
                Windows operating system which you can use to work easily
                with C++ programming language. One of the popular IDE is
                <b><a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26">Code::Blocks.</a></b>
                Once you have downloaded the setup file of Code::Blocks
                from the given link open it and follow the instruction to install.<br><br>
                After successfully installing Code::Blocks, go to File
                menu -> Select New and create an Empty file.<br>
                Now write your C++ program in this empty file and
                save the file with a ‘.cpp’ extension.<br>
                After saving the file with ‘.cpp’ extension, go to the
                Build menu and choose the Build and Run option.<br><br>
                <div class="subtitle">
                  <b>Mac OS X Installation: </b> 
                </div><br>
                If you are a Mac user,you have to
                download Xcode. To download Xcode you have to visit the
                apple website or you can search it on apple app store. 
                You will find all the necessary install
                instructions there.<br><br>
                After successfully installing Xcode, open the Xcode
                application.<br>
                To create a new project. Go to File menu -> select
                New -> select Project. This will create a new project
                for you.<br>
                Now in the next window you have to choose a
                template for your project. To choose a C++ template
                choose Application option which is under the OS X
                section on the left side bar. Now choose
                command-line tools from available options and hit
                the Next button.<br>
                On the next window provide all the necessary
                details like ‘name of organisation’, ‘Product Name’
                etc. But make sure to choose the language as C++ .
                After filling the details hit the next button to proceed
                to further steps.<br>
                Choose the location where you want to save your
                project. After this choose the main.cpp file from the
                directory list on the left side-bar.<br>
                Now after opening the main.cpp file, you will see a
                pre written c++ program or template is provided.
                You may change this program as per your
                requirement. To run your C++ program you have to
                go to the Product menu and choose the Run option
                from the dropdown.
